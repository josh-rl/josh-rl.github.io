					With a half mile of soft white sand, turquoise water and gentle
					breezes, Kailua Beach Park located on the Windward Coast is a local
					favorite. A hub for water sports, Kailua Beach welcomes visitors and
					locals to windsurf, body board, kayak and parasail. Conveniently,
					kayak rentals, dive shops and beachwear boutiques are located nearby
					the beach.

					Kailua Beach's proximity to several small islands makes it an ideal
					place for adventuring and kayaking. Closest to the shore is barren
					Flat Island, and far off to the east are the Mokulua Islands, commonly
					known as "Moks" or "Twin Islands." To the west of Kailua Beach is
					Kalama Beach, a family-friendly beach with mild waves great for
					teaching kids how to surf and body board. To the east is Kailua's
					sister beach, Lanikai Beach, which is another beautiful stretch of
					sand, although less accessible since it's nestled between residential
					housing and parking is limited.
