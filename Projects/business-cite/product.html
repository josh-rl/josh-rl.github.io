			We offer several software based packages. This includes over the phone
			diagnostics and in-house trouble shooting. Pricing is determined based
			on the complexity of the problem (email us for more info on pricing).
			Problems can be as simple as trying to install with the wrong drivers
			or they can range to having an incompatibile hardware configuration so
			if you aren't sure, don't hesitate to get in contact!

		<h2>Viruses:</h2>
		<p class="products">
			With the rise of ransom-ware, we recommend keeping an external backup
			of all important data. Anti-malware software is your next step to
			keeping your data safe. If both of those measures still aren't enough,
			we offer a simple data recovery service with a clean install of your
			original OS. Unfortunately, when it comes to data recovery after a
			malware attack there aren't many options if your device isn't
			backed up or your hard drive is out of warranty.
